## SOURCES OF COMMAND AUTHORITY

Article II, § 2 of the United States Constitution provides the original source of command authority to the President as Commander-in-Chief. Military command includes two distinct components: (1) operational control (OPCON) and (2) administrative control (ADCON).

## Chain of Command

-	 The President and Secretary of Defense (SecDef ) exercise authority, direction, and control of the Air Force through two distinct chains of command

  --	 The operational branch runs from the President, through SecDef, to the commanders of combatant commands for missions and forces assigned or attached to their commands

  --	 For purposes other than operational direction of forces assigned to the combatant commands, the chain of command runs from the President to SecDef to the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF), and thereafter, as prescribed by SecAF in AFPD 51-6, Command and Administrative Proceedings and its implementing instructions. SecAF has shared administrative command and control with the combatant commander over Air Force forces assigned or attached to combatant commands.

-	 The chain of command within the Air Force runs from SecAF to the major command commanders to their subordinate commanders. SecAF exercises this command authority over Airmen through the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF).
The Concept of Command by Uniformed Military Personnel

-	 Concept of command carries dual functions

    - Legal authority over people, including power to discipline

    - Legal responsibility for the mission and resources

-	 Command devolves upon an individual, not a staff

  --	 A commander is an officer who occupies a position of command pursuant to orders of appointment or by assumption of command
  --	 A commander exercises control through subordinate commanders, principal assistants, and other officers to whom the commander has delegated authorities

  --	 Staff, including vice and deputy commanders, have no command functions. They assist the commander through advising, planning, researching, and investigating. Subordinate officers must issue all directives in the commander’s name.

  --	 Commanders may delegate administrative duties or authorities to members of their staff and subordinate commanders as needed. However, delegating duties incident to the discharge of responsibilities does not relieve the commander of the responsibility to exercise command supervision.

  --	 **Be mindful of the following constraints:**
    ---	 Duties specifically imposed on commanders by federal law, such as the UCMJ, shall not be delegated to staff officers
    ---	 Duties that have been designated non-delegable by a higher authority shall not be delegated
    ---	 A commander should exercise sound judgment and discretion in not delegating duties of clear importance

### Command Authority over Active Duty Forces

-	 The commander’s authority over military members extends to conduct of the members whether on or off the installation. The commander exercises authority by virtue of his/her status as a superior commissioned officer.

-	 Enlisted members take an oath upon enlistment to obey the lawful orders of their duly appointed superiors

-	 Articles 89, 90, 91, and 92 of the UCMJ prohibit disrespect towards, or the failure to obey, superior officers

### Command Authority over Reservists

-	 Commanders always have administrative authority to hold reservists accountable for misconduct occurring on or off-duty, irrespective of their military status when the misconduct occurred

-	 Commanders have UCMJ authority over reservists only when in military status

### Command Authority over Civilians 

-	 The commander has authority over his/her civilian employees

  --	 The commander can give promotions and bonuses, as well as impose sanctions 

  --	 AFI 36-series defines this relationship 
  
-	 The commander has less authority over nonemployee civilians on base 

  --	 As “mayor” of the base, the installation commander has authority to maintain
order and discipline, and to protect federal resources 
  
  --	 As a practical matter, this authority may be limited to detaining individuals for civilian law enforcement officials and barring them from the installation 
  
  --	 The installation commander may bar an individual from the base for misconduct but must follow certain procedural requirements 
  
  --	 The commander has no authority over civilians off base
