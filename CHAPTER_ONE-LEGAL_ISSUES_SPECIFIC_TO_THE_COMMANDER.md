## SOURCES OF COMMAND AUTHORITY

Article II, § 2 of the United States Constitution provides the original source of command authority to the President as Commander-in-Chief. Military command includes two distinct components: (1) operational control (OPCON) and (2) administrative control (ADCON).

## Chain of Command

* The President and Secretary of Defense (SecDef ) exercise authority, direction, and control of the Air Force through two distinct chains of command
    - The operational branch runs from the President, through SecDef, to the commanders of combatant commands for missions and forces assigned or attached to their commands
    - For purposes other than operational direction of forces assigned to the combatant commands, the chain of command runs from the President to SecDef to the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF), and thereafter, as prescribed by SecAF in AFPD 51-6, Command and Administrative Proceedings and its implementing instructions. SecAF has shared administrative command and control with the combatant commander over Air Force forces assigned or attached to combatant commands.
* The chain of command within the Air Force runs from SecAF to the major command commanders to their subordinate commanders. SecAF exercises this command authority over Airmen through the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF).

### The Concept of Command by Uniformed Military Personnel

* The Concept of command carries dual functions
    - Legal authority over people, including power to discipline
    - Legal responsibility for the mission and resources
* Command devolves upon an individual, not a staff
    - A commander is an officer who occupies a position of command pursuant to orders of appointment or by assumption of command
    - A commander exercises control through subordinate commanders, principal assistants, and other officers to whom the commander has delegated authorities
    -  Staff, including vice and deputy commanders, have no command functions. They assist the commander through advising, planning, researching, and investigating. Subordinate officers must issue all directives in the commander’s name.
    - Commanders may delegate administrative duties or authorities to members of their staff and subordinate commanders as needed. However, delegating duties incident to the discharge of responsibilities does not relieve the commander of the responsibility to exercise command supervision.
    - **Be mindful of the following constraints:**
      - Duties specifically imposed on commanders by federal law, such as the UCMJ, shall not be delegated to staff officers
      - Duties that have been designated non-delegable by a higher authority shall not be delegated
      - A commander should exercise sound judgment and discretion in not delegating duties of clear importance

### Command Authority over Active Duty Forces

* The commander’s authority over military members extends to conduct of the members whether on or off the installation. The commander exercises authority by virtue of his/her status as a superior commissioned officer.
    - Enlisted members take an oath upon enlistment to obey the lawful orders of their duly appointed superiors
    - Articles 89, 90, 91, and 92 of the UCMJ prohibit disrespect towards, or the failure to obey, superior officers

### Command Authority over Reservists

* Commanders always have administrative authority to hold reservists accountable for misconduct occurring on or off-duty, irrespective of their military status when the misconduct occurred
* Commanders have UCMJ authority over reservists only when in military status

### Command Authority over Civilians 

* The commander has authority over his/her civilian employees
    - Rhe commander can give promotions and bonuses, as well as impose sanctions 
    - AFI 36-series defines this relationship 
* The commander has less authority over nonemployee civilians on base 
    - As “mayor” of the base, the installation commander has authority to maintain
order and discipline, and to protect federal resources 
    - As a practical matter, this authority may be limited to detaining individuals for civilian law enforcement officials and barring them from the installation 
    - The installation commander may bar an individual from the base for misconduct but must follow certain procedural requirements 
    - The commander has no authority over civilians off base

------------------------------


## COMMAND SUCCESSION

An officer is vested with command in one of two ways, either by assuming command or by appointment to command. Both assumption and appointment are based on seniority and may be either temporary or permanent.

### Appointment to Command

* Appointment to command occurs by an act of the President, the Secretary of the Air Force, or by his/her delegate
* An officer who is assigned to an organization, present for duty, and eligible to command may be appointed to command if they are at least equal in grade to all other eligible officers, without regard to rank within grade

### Assumption of Command

* Assumption of command is authorized under federal law and Air Force regulations when command passes to the senior military officer assigned to the organization who is present for duty and eligible to command
    - Authority to assume command is inherent in that officer’s status as the senior officer in both grade (captain, lieutenant colonel, colonel) and rank (seniority within a grade)
    - No officer may command another officer of higher grade who is present for duty and otherwise eligible to command
* Assumption of command may be permanent or temporary
    - A temporary assumption or appointment is used when the commander being replaced is only temporarily absent or disabled
    - Absence or disability for only short periods does not incapacitate the commander and normally does not warrant an assumption of command by another officer
    - An officer can assume command only of an organization to which that officer is assigned by competent authority, except that the officer serving as the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for a given contingency operation exercises command authority over those Air Force members deployed in support of that contingency

### Method for Assumption or Appointment to Command

* Use written orders to announce and record command succession, unless precluded by exigencies
* Use standard memorandum format or use AF Form 35, Announcement of Appointment To/Assumption of Command, to document such orders. AFI 51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command, Attach. 2, sets out detailed instructions for preparing the AF Form 35. Consult AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, for uniformity of order format and general order publishing guidance.

### Resumption of Command after Temporary Absence
* No need to publish assumption of or appointment to command orders when the original commander resumes command after a temporary absence, so long as they are still equal or senior in grade to any other officer then present for duty, assigned to the organization, and eligible to command
* If during the permanent commander’s temporary absence, another officer senior in grade to him/her, who is eligible to command, is assigned or attached to the organization, then the returning commander may not resume command unless appointed to command
Special Rules and Limitations on Command
* No commander may appoint his own successor
* There is no title or position of “acting commander;” the term is not authorized
Limitations to Command based upon Type of Personnel
* Enlisted members cannot exercise command
* Civilians cannot exercise command
    - Civilians may hold supervisory positions, and provide supervision to military and civilian personnel in a unit. However, civilians cannot assume“military command” or exercise command over military members within the unit. Except as limited by law, a civilian leader of a unit is authorized to perform all functions normally requiring action by the respective unit commander.


--	 Units designated to be led by civilian directors will not have commanders and members of the unit or subordinate units may not assume command of the unit. Thus, designations of individuals to lead the unit should be conducted in advance in the event of a director’s absence.
--	 Functions which require a commander (e.g., imposition of nonjudicial punishment; initiation of administrative discharges) will be established by competent command authority, either by attaching military members for these limited purposes to a unit led by a commander, or by accomplishing these functions at a command level above the unit.
-	 Officers assigned to HQ USAF cannot assume command of personnel, unless competent authority specifically directs
-	 Chaplains cannot exercise command, although they do have the authority to give lawful orders and exercise functions of operational supervision, control, and direction
-	 Students cannot command an Air Force school or similar organization
-	 Judge Advocates may only exercise command if expressly authorized by The Judge Advocate General, as the senior ranking member among a group of prisoners of war, or under emergency field conditions
Limitations of Command Based Upon Organization
-	 Flying Units: May only be commanded by Line of the Air Force officers with a current aeronautical rating, as defined by AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges. The rated officer must hold a currently effective aeronautical rating or crewmember certification, and must be qualified for aviation service in an airframe flown by the unit to be commanded.
--	 Exception 1: Officers from other military departments who have USAF-equivalent crewmember ratings or certifications can command consolidated flying training organizations in accordance with appropriate interservice agreements
--	 Exception 2: Certain types of organizations, such as air base wings or groups, which have multiple missions that include responsibility for controlling or directing flying activities, are considered non-flying units and may be commanded by non-rated officers
CHAPTER ONE Legal Issues Specific to the Commander 7

-	 Command of Active Duty Units by Reserve Officers: Only reserve component officers on extended active duty orders can command organizations of the regular Air Force. “Extended active duty” is defined as a period of 90 days or more during which the officer is on active duty (other than for training) orders. The COMAFFOR or delegate may authorize reserve component officers not on extended active duty to command regular Air Force units operating under the COMAFFOR’s authority, though COMAFFOR may delegate this authority no lower than the commanders of aerospace expeditionary wings for expeditionary units operating under the COMAFFOR’s authority.
-	 Command of Reserve Units by Regular Officers: Regular officers and reserve officers on extended active duty cannot command organizations of the Air Force Reserve (AFR) unless approved by HQ USAF/RE
-	 Medical/Healthcare Units: Only officers designated as a medical (including nurses), dental, veterinary, medical service, or biomedical sciences officer may command organizations and installations whose primary mission involves health care or the health profession
-	 Command of Installation: Officers quartered on an installation, but assigned to another organization not charged with operating that installation, cannot assume command of the installation by virtue of seniority
